# fanduel-lineup-generator

Instructions:
- Enter salaries of targeted players in each corresponding position array
- Adjust minimum salary preference 

Feature planning:
- Create a method to randomize until the requirements are satisfied instead of error messages
- Change the salary array to player/salary hash
- Add rating hash to change the program into an optimizer

Future DraftKings version:
- Need to create "Guard" to include PG and SG, "Forward" to include both SF and PF, and Utility to include all positions
- Need to eliminate preselected players by archiving seed/random functionality
